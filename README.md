# Fraud-Detector

In this project I applied various different machine learning models from SciKit Learnâ€™s libraries to identify fraudulent credit card transitions within a large dataset of transactions. The dataset that I used can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

I made use of features that were already reduced using principal component analysis to identify fraudulent transitions. The best models used were able to classify transactions with a 99.94 accuracy and an F1 score of 87 percent. In performing this analysis I tuned hyperparameters and applied grid searching to find the best possible hyperparameter combinations. I also used matplotlib to showcase my results.
